My personal attempt ( in a few hours POC, mainly spent diggin skills 'round the web ;p ) at a colored interactive prompt

After hearing about it, share goals with the "fishshell", which is wayy more advanced [ & I suppose, wayy less hacky .. ]

[fishshell](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/tutorial.html)

Nb: one of the constraints that I imposed upon myself was keeping using the bash shell, as well as using only bash scripts to "make that bear dance" ;P
